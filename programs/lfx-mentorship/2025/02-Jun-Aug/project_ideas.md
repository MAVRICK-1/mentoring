## Proposed Project ideas

### Kubernetes

#### Graduate the kubeadm feature gate WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents to GA

- Description:  
The feature gate WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents is used to
enhance the health checks performed by kubeadm on control plane node creation,
to not only check the availability of the kube-apisever, but also check
the kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. In kubeadm 1.33, the feature gate
was promoted to Beta. As part of this LFX project it can be promoted to GA,
by finalizing the remaining work, such as, code changes, documentation updates
and e2e test updates.
- Expected Outcome: The feature gate is graduated to GA
- Recommended Skills: golang, Kubernetes, kubeadm
- Mentor(s):
  - Shida Qiu (@SataQiu)
  - Paco Xu (@pacoxu)
- Type: maintainer mentorship (only for maintainers to work on as part of a one-off LFX Project)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/2907

### KubeStellar

#### Building a Plugin System for KubeStellar

- Description:  
This project aims to develop a plugin system for KubeStellar that will allow users to discover, install, and manage plugins that extend KubeStellar's functionality. The plugin system will provide a centralized hub for community-contributed plugins, enhancing KubeStellar's extensibility and user experience. The implementation will include a backend API written in Go and a frontend interface built with React.

- Expected Outcome
  - A fully functional plugin system integrated into KubeStellar's UI
  - Backend API for plugin management (upload, discovery, installation, updates)
  - Frontend components for browsing, searching, and installing plugins
  - Plugin versioning and compatibility checking
  - User ratings and reviews for plugins
  - Documentation for plugin developers and users

- Recommended Skills
  - Go 
  - React.ts
  - REST API
  - Kubernetes
  - KubeStellar 
  - Docker
  - containerization
  - Git
  - GitHub workflow

#### Implementing a Model Context Protocol for KubeStellar MCP Server

- Description:  
This project aims to develop a Model Context Protocol for KubeStellar's Management Control Plane (MCP) server. The protocol will establish a standardized communication framework between KubeStellar's internal components and the AI models used for command interpretation. By defining clear context boundaries, semantic structures, and state management patterns, the protocol will enable the MCP server to maintain consistent understanding of the multi-cluster environment while processing natural language management commands across KubeStellar deployments.

- Expected Outcome
  - A fully specified Model Context Protocol defining the interaction between KubeStellar and AI models
  - Implementation of protocol handlers in TypeScript or Python for the MCP server
  - Context management system that maintains KubeStellar state information for accurate command interpretation
  - Serialization and deserialization mechanisms for efficiently passing cluster state to models
  - Protocol extension mechanisms for supporting different AI providers
  - Performance optimizations for minimizing latency in command processing
  - Comprehensive test suite validating protocol reliability under various operational conditions

- Recommended Skills
  - KubeStellar
  - Model Context Protocol
  - protocol design and implementation
  - TypeScript
  - Python
  - AI model
  - GenAi  
  - serialization formats 
  - efficient data structures
  - distributed systems state management

#### Developing a Marketplace UI and Optimize the Current UI

- Description:  
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive plugin marketplace UI for KubeStellar that enables users to easily discover, install, update, and delete plugins directly from the interface. The marketplace will provide a seamless user experience with intuitive navigation, detailed plugin information, and streamlined management workflows. Additionally, the project will implement advanced resource filtering capabilities throughout the KubeStellar UI, allowing users to efficiently search, sort, and filter various resources based on multiple criteria.

- Expected Outcome:
  - A fully functional plugin marketplace UI integrated into KubeStellar
  - Installation, deletion, and update workflows for plugins with visual feedback
  - Plugin categorization, ratings, and search functionality
  - Dependency management and compatibility checking for plugins
  - Advanced resource filtering system across the UI with support for multiple filter criteria
  - Filter persistence across user sessions
  - Responsive design that works across different device sizes
  - Performance optimizations to ensure smooth interaction even with many plugins/resources
  - Installation and Setup Guide integrated directly into KubeStellar UI with cluster readiness checker, guided installation wizard, and real-time error feedback and resolution flows

- Recommended Skills:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - REST API integration
  - Golang
  - Kubernetes
  - KubeStellar
  - State management
  - GitHub workflow
